  "name": "Sensory Overload During Circle Time",
  "description": "Morning circle time begins calmly with 6 children and 2 adults. The teacher leads a singing activity. Around minute 3, construction noise begins outside the window (drilling). Child_3, who has high sensory sensitivity, starts showing signs of distress - first covering ears, then rocking. The teaching assistant notices and guides child_3 to the sensory corner. Meanwhile, child_1 and child_2 are engaged in the activity and attempt to interact with each other. By minute 8, the drilling stops, and child_3 is supported back to the group with a fidget toy. The session ends with a calming song.",
