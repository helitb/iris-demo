  "description": "Free play session in the play area. Child_2, who typically engages in solitary play, is playing with blocks alone. Child_4 approaches and watches. The teacher notices and provides gentle facilitation, suggesting they could build together. Child_2 initially ignores child_4, but after the teacher models sharing a block, child_2 hands a block to child_4. They engage in brief parallel play that evolves into cooperative building. Child_2 makes eye contact twice and says a few words. This is a significant social breakthrough for child_2.",
