  "name": "Echolalia as Communication",
  "description": "Structured activity time where children are working on puzzles at tables. Child_5 uses delayed echolalia functionally - repeating phrases from a favorite TV show to communicate needs and emotions. The teacher recognizes these patterns and responds to the underlying intent. When child_5 says 'to infinity and beyond' while reaching for a puzzle piece another child has, the teacher interprets this as a request and facilitates sharing. Later, child_5 echoes 'I'm not scared' (from a movie) when the lights flicker briefly, which the teacher acknowledges as self-reassurance. The session demonstrates how echolalia serves communicative functions.",
